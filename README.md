A tool to monitor and store clipboard content. This project is just for me to learn rust.

Most of the code is generated by cursor.

## Inspired by:
1. https://github.com/1Password/arboard (How to use objc2)
2. https://github.com/DoumanAsh/clipboard-master (How to monitor the clipboard)
3. https://github.com/DargonLee/easy_pasta (What this project will do)


## TODO:
- [ ] provide an storage interface for variant store methods
- [ ] make it to a lib to enable other code import
- [ ] implement frontend in a new project
